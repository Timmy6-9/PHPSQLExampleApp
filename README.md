A very basic Laravel example project, consisting of a simple frontend and backend with a MySQL database. The application itself is supposed to be an incredibly basic form of CRM, storing information about the user's clients.

The main purpose of this project was to get to grips with laravel, learn php and refresh my knowledge of SQL.
